# What is HackTheBox?
HackTheBox is an online penetration testing platform, where you can legally hack the vulnerable machines
which try to stimulate real world scenarios in a CTF style, also you have an option to hack the offline challenges like,
Steganography, reversing, etc. The best thing I think about HackTheBox along with the awesome machines is the community.
They have got a huge community of professional penetration testers, security researchers, skids  and other hackers who are always
willing to help and enrich your knowledge.
